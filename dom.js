//DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
//      Obejct that represents the page you see in the browser
//      and provides you with an API to interest with it.
//      Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document
//      and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation
//      JS can access the DOM to dynamically
//      change the content, structure and style of the web page.
